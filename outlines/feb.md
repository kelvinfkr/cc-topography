### IPCC matching
![](../plots/ipcc_matching.png)

Almost half of unmatched AR5 citations searched for, of which about a quarter

Scopus scraping is down again, and needs to be fixed before I continue

### Topic entropy across ...

Entropy measures the distribution of a variable within a subset of documents,
high scores indicate that the subset contains a balanced mixture of the variable,
while low entropy indicates that a small number of variable values predominate
in the distribution.
